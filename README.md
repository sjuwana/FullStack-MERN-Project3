I choose to create a book management system for librarian to keep track of the book database. The goal is to have a full book management system incorporating books borrowing and lending just like a real library.

# &nbsp;Overview

## Building the Library Project 

The project was designed using a combination several technologies such as React, JS, CSS, Google API map and News API. Further, we also use Coolers.io to pick images, Material UI to help design the front-end, BrandCrowd for logo design, and Trello to as our project management app. This project was developed in 10 days.
