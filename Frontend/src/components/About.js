          Somerset Library probably began sometime between 1751 and 1787 under
          the pastorate of Rev. Dr. Samuel Kennedy, fourth minister of the
          Presbyterian Church in downtown Somerset County. 1760​- Bernards
          Township is created by Charter. 1809- The founding members had been
          loaning books and pamphlets among themselves and formed an association
          around that activity, modeling themselves after Benjamin Franklin’s
          literary group, the Junto Club of Philadelphia. At the Library's first
          location on the 2nd floor of what is now Weichert Realtors on Henry
          Street, books were brought in on certain nights and exchanged There
          were 53 subscribers who paid a membership fee of 25¢ per person. Each
          subscriber received a catalog with the full list of books. In 1893,
          the library was relocated to the home of Mary and Elizabeth Barkalow
          to what is now 31 S. Finley Ave (pictured). The Barkalow sisters
          housed the library in exchange for free memberships and were
          eventually awarded salaries of $1/week.

          May 21, 1898- Efforts to organize led to a mutual loan library and the
          incorporation of the Somerset Public Library in 1898. This we record
          as the official beginning of the Library structure we know today,
          although several significant changes can be noted since then. Then,
          just as now, the Library served as a center for community life. Soon
          after incorporation, the library moved to 23 South Finley Avenue (now
          the home of Ridge Pizza), which had been remodeled by the owner,
          Samuel S. Childs. The remodel of the building also included a small
          stage and a bowling alley. The bowling alley was used to provide a
          source of income for the library, which had no municipal funding at
          that time. By 1900, it owned over 1,000 volumes and boasted more than
          200 members.

          1909- The library moved to its 4th location, on the corner of West Oak
          and North Finley. The remodel included a duplex apartment to be used
          as a source of income for the library. 1919- The library owned more
          than 4,500 volumes. 1935- The Township Committee and the Board of
          Education contributed to the library annually. October 12, 1974 -
          Volunteers, mostly made up of Kiwanis Club members and Ridge High
          School Students, brought donated file boxes to help move 26,000 books
          to their new home at 32 South Maple Ave. The "Book Brigade" took just
          2 hours and saved the library thousands in moving fees.
